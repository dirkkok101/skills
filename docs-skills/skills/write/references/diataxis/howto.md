# How-To Guide Template

A how-to guide is a **task-oriented** set of steps to achieve a specific goal. The reader already knows what they want to do and needs practical directions.

## Key Characteristics
- Reader has a specific goal in mind and some existing knowledge
- Steps solve a real-world problem, not a learning exercise
- Flexible — acknowledges different starting points and variations
- Focused on the task, not background theory
- Named after the goal: "How to {do X}"
